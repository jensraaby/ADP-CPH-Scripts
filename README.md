ADP-CPH-Scripts
===============
Prerequisites:
Luggage: https://github.com/unixorn/luggage
Ruby (tested with MRI 1.8.7)


These scripts are not really intended for forking. 

There are a number of Luggage-based package Makefiles which basically compile to a PKG (optionally compressed into a dmg) and can easily be deployed using Apple Remote Desktop.

There are also some config files and a Luggage Makefile for Munki, the OS X package deployment tool created by Greg Neagle.
